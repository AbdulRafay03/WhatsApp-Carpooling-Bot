# Carpooling-WhatsApp-Bot


## Overview
This project provides a WhatsApp-based carpooling solution where users can offer or request rides by sending messages to a WhatsApp group. The application processes these messages, extracts relevant information, and matches users based on their routes and requirements.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- ngrok

### Steps
1. **Download Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python App.py
   ```

3. **Start ngrok**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

4. **Update the Webhook**:
   - Copy the public URL provided by ngrok.
   - Paste this URL into the webhook field in your Whapi channel settings.

5. **Update the Config File**:
   - Set your desired chat ID and API token in the `config.json` file.

6. **Start Messaging**:
   - Send a message to the connected WhatsApp group to initiate the connection.

Thatâ€™s it! Your messages will now be processed.

## Current Issues
1. **Destination Extraction**:
   - Difficulty in reliably identifying the destination from messages.
   - Inconsistent extraction of all intermediate locations.

2. **Matching**:
   - Imperfect matching between offers and requests due to the above extraction issues.

## Future Work
1. **Database Integration**:
   - Store messages in a database for improved management and retrieval.

2. **Enhanced Matching**:
   - Implement a better matching function to reduce time complexity and improve accuracy.

3. **Route Improvement**:
   - Create predefined routes.
   - Automatically fill in all locations between the starting and ending points if only those are mentioned.

4. **Message Cleanup**:
   - Use the database to automatically delete obsolete offers and requests (e.g., messages where the departure time has passed).

## Tools Used
1. **Programming Languages & Frameworks**:
   - Python: For development and model training.
   - Flask: For building the web server.

2. **Libraries**:
   - `sklearn`: For machine learning tasks.
   - `spacy`: For natural language processing.
   - `re`: For regular expression-based text parsing.
   - `ngrok`: For exposing the local server to the internet.
   - `rapidfuzz`: For fuzzy string matching.

3. **Other Tools**:
   - Any other libraries required for the project should be listed in `requirements.txt`.
